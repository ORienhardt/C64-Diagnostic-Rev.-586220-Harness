# C64-Diagnostic-Rev.-586220-Harness
The Diagnostic Rev. 586220 is a widely accepted test tool for the Commodore C64. It tests the RAM, ROMs and 
the peripheral chips (VIC, SID, CIA). To test all interfaces, a feedback is required. This is provided by this harness.

This repository contains all eagle files, gerber files, BOM, descriptions and cable drawings. The main documentation is contained in the User Port section.

Depending on where the parts and pcbs are purchased, the price for the complete harness is less than 20€ (2019).

Now, a 3D printed case for the user port and the cassette donge is designed and the stl files etc. are available here.

# Rev. 1
Revision 1 is released now. It fixes the "False OK" of the Control Port test, while the keyboard dongle is inserted. This is a phenomenon, that applies to all sorts of harnesses for Diagnostic Rev. 586220. Please refer to <a src="http://tech.guitarsite.de/c64_diag_harness.html">my website</a>

# Extended Keyboard Dongle (do not build, unless you are sure, what it is required for)
A fix for existing harnesses is the <b>extended</b> Keyboard Dongle. It can be combined with Rev. 0 of this harness and all other Harnesses. It only requires a connection to the Cassette Port Dongle. It is not required with Rev. 1 of the harness or later.

# Keyboard dongle with 90° header
Some people want to test the C64 mainboard while being mounted. The keyboard cable connector is conflicting here. Some leave out the strain relief. This is not a great solution. A 90° boc pin header can be used insted of the vertical one. This swapps the pins, due to a different orientation. Since the symmetrical pinning of the header and the non-directional properties of the analog switches, this does not matter and is working fine. I only build this kind of KB dongle now.

# The SMD Version
This version has no functional updates compared to Rev. 2 of the UP PCB and Rev. 1 of the Cassette SMD. Some prefer building SMD assemblies (me included). It is now fully tested.

# Recommended Screws
For the case, I have used 2.9mm x 9.5mm (self taping) screws for sheet metal (C 2,9x9,5H, DIN 7981).  

# C128 diagnostics
They keyboard PCB for the C128 is released now and included in this repository.

A cartridge with the Diagnostic Rev. 785260 software is required. I recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/bwack/Versa64Cart">Versa64cart</a> for this purpose. Other 8k generic cartridges might also be working. /EXROM and /GAME have to be HIGH/open.

<img src="https://github.com/ORienhardt/C64-Diagnostic-Rev.-586220-Harness/blob/master/Diag586220_Harness/C128_Keyboard_PCB/Rev.%201/Pictures/0662_C128_Diag_Harness_test.JPG" width="300" alt="Diagnostic Rev. 785260">

The <b>C128D and C128D-CR</b> require a longer cable (1m) between the user port PCB and the Cassette port dongle. Both work with the <b>C128D Diagnostic Rev. 785260</b>.  The keyboard ribbon cable should be 90cm for the C128D.

The cassette port ribbon cable requires to be 25cm long for the C128 and 70cm long for the C128D/DCR.

The <b>C128D-CR</b> does not provide +5V at the keyboard D-Sub jack. The keyboard dongle <b>does not work</b> here. A solution needs to be developed.  

I have noticed, that not all female D-Sub connectors provide a proper contact with the pin header on the C128 mainboard. Please keep this in mind. The recommended type is Amphenol/FCI DB25S064TLF (Digikey 609-1519-ND, more sources in the BOM v1.1 or later).

# SX-64 Diagnostics
Diagnosing an SX/64 requires disconnecting the internal disk drive. A cassette port dongle cannot be used, so the analog switches for testing the control ports need to be switched manually. This is an option with teh User Port PCB Rev. 2.

Also the Keyboard can be tested with the C128 KB dongle and a gender changer.

The Diagnostic Rev. 586220++ is capable of detecting the SX-64 Kernal and then skip testing the cassette port.

# Other
you might want to check Jeff Birt's <a href="https://github.com/Jeff-Birt/COREi64_Dual_Diag_Cart_Case/tree/master">case</a> for the harness, too.

Find additional info about the harness on my <a href="http://tech.guitarsite.de/c64_diag_harness.html">website</a>.

Jeff Birt provided the information of the cable lengths for C128 diagnostics. This is part of the documentation now. 

# User Port PCB Rev. 2
The user Port PCB Rev. 2 fits into the User Port Case Rev. 1. It adds an option for the SX-64: Since the SX-64 has no
Cassette Port, the Feedbacks for the CVontrol Port are not switched automatically by the software. Rev. 2 allows to
switch on the feedbacks manually. A User Port Case for thei option has been made. It incorporates a cut out for a slide
switch (standard 19mm hole pitch). This switch can be connected top JP1. For this option the cutpad has to be cut open.
